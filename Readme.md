This is a simple bit of Arduino code that operates the Monster box
![Halloween Box](/halloween.jpg)

It uses a simple PIR to detect and a motor control to drive a windscreen washer motor.

The Green light is seperate and just some RGB led strips.Ive put a fog machine in there in also with a 
remote control device.
